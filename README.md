# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:
- Perform an exploratory analysis on PyBer's ride sharing data.
- Create multiple visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data.
- Help company to improve access to ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.
- Create a summary DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type.
- Create a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results:

The image below displays the data accumulated throughout the analysis with each city type.

From the data provided we can see that Urban cities are most busiest likely because it's more populated while the Rural cities are making more for average fare per ride but has a slower pace in gathering momentun.

Another visualization is the line chart for total fare by city type:

## Summary:

PyBer has many things going right for them but there's three recommendations I'll like to give:

    1. Lowering the fare per ride for Rural cities can bring more clientele and in turn boost the overall fares.
  
    2. There seems to be a boost of passengers for all city types in late February that would do even better
       if around that same time a coupon or an incentive to use the ride sharing app would come out.
